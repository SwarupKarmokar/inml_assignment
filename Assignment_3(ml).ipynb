    "Different Types of Supervised Learning:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Regression:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In regression, a single output value is produced using training data. \n",
    "This value is a probabilistic interpretation, which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables.\n",
    "For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the output has discrete values based on a set of independent variables. \n",
    "This method can flounder when dealing with non-linear and multiple decision boundaries. \n",
    "Also, it is not flexible enough to capture complex relationships in datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classification:\n",
    "    \n",
    "It involves grouping the data into classes. \n",
    "If you are thinking of extending credit to a person, you can use classification to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter. \n",
    "When the supervised learning algorithm labels input data into two distinct classes, it is called binary classification. \n",
    "Multiple classifications means categorizing data into more than two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Naive Bayesian Model:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. \n",
    "It is a method of assigning class labels using a direct acyclic graph. \n",
    "The graph comprises one parent node and multiple children nodes. \n",
    "And each child node is assumed to be independent and separate from the parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that contains conditional control statements, comprising decisions and their probable consequences. \n",
    "The output relates to the labelling of unforeseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the tree representation, the leaf nodes correspond to class labels, and the internal nodes represent the attributes. \n",
    "A decision tree can be used to solve problems with discrete attributes as well as boolean functions. \n",
    "Some of the notable decision tree algorithms are ID3 and CART.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random Forest Model:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The random forest model is an ensemble method. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees and outputs a classification of the individual trees.\n",
    "Suppose you want to predict which undergraduate students will perform well in GMAT – a test taken for admission into graduate management programs. \n",
    "A random forest model would accomplish the task, given the demographic and educational factors of a set of students who have previously taken the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Neural Networks:\n",
    "    \n",
    "This algorithm is designed to cluster raw input, recognize patterns, or interpret sensory data. \n",
    "Despite their multiple advantages, neural networks require significant computational resources.\n",
    "It can get complicated to fit a neural network when there are thousands of observations.\n",
    "It is also called the ‘black-box’ algorithm as interpreting the logic behind their predictions can be challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm developed in the year 1990.\n",
    "It draws from the statistical learning theory developed by Vap Nick. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM separates hyperplanes, which makes it a discriminative classifier. \n",
    "The output is produced in the form of an optimal hyperplane that categorizes new examples. \n",
    "SVMs are closely connected to the kernel framework and used in diverse fields.\n",
    "Some examples include bioinformatics, pattern recognition, and multimedia information retrieval.\n",
